MSE & RMSE:
The Random Forest model outperformed the RNN with a lower MSE (0.80 vs. 0.98) and RMSE (0.89 vs. 0.99). Lower values indicate better model performance since they measure the average squared error and its square root, respectively.

R-squared (R²):
Random Forest also achieved a higher R² (0.54) compared to the RNN (0.44). R² measures the proportion of the variance explained by the model, where higher values indicate better performance.
